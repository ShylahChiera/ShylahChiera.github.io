<p class="software-title">The Event App</p>
<p class="software-description">Contracted for GSC, I designed and implemented a
robust application to help promote marketing strategies for entertainment events.
I worked as the lead and sole engineer to successfully deliver the needs of the client.
Following the tactics of Agile Software engineering I made weekly and sometimes daily goals
which translated as sprints to the client.

</br></br>The client wanted to ensure they would recieve, both Android and
iOS application platforms. Because of time restriction, I chose to build the app in React Native, a javascript
based language with dual platform capabilities. For easier integration with React Native I built the back-end using
Google's Firebase Real-Time Database and Storage, which proved quicker and easier deployment of the event app

<p class="software-title">Hidden Gems</p>
<p class="software-description">Lead and organized a team of five people in a portfolio development prgram, #CUNYCodes.
The idea of Hidden Gems stemmed from the lack of discovery in new cities. We decided to incorporate Google API and Foursquare API
to manipulate the way visitors discover mom & pop shops or a route less traveled.

</br></br>To ensure that each team member learned and grew from the experience we built an iOS app. I set up and AWS EC2 server
and ensured the back-end was running smoothly for deployment of the app. I created a mySQL database for easy integration
with our LAMP stack. </p>
