	<h3>a little about me</h3>
	<p>Software Engineer, artistic, math enthusiast. I earned my B.Sc. in applied mathematics from CUNY The City College. After graduating I found a passion in software engineering, I'm nearly all self-taught, I apply my mathematics and art to computer science. In my free time I love creating art and perusing Pinterest for DIY projects. I hope to integrate my mathematical reasoning with software engineering to help the world of machine learning prosper with a creatively intuitive touch.</p>
